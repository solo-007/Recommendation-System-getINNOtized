## Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce event data to understand user behavior, predict item properties, identify abnormal users, and develop recommendation algorithms. The goal is to leverage these insights to enhance the product page experience and improve user engagement and conversion.
It follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology and explores recommendation approaches.

The project aims to:
‚Ä¢ Find abnormal users of e-shop. 
‚Ä¢ Generate features 
‚Ä¢ Build a model 
‚Ä¢ Create a metric that helps to evaluate quality of the model 

---

## Data Description
The analysis utilizes three datasets:

`events.csv`: Contains user interaction events with timestamps, visitor IDs, event types (view, addtocart, transaction), item IDs, and transaction IDs (for transaction events).

`item_properties.csv`: Contains item properties with timestamps, item IDs, property names, and property values.

`category_tree.—Åsv`: which describes category tree

## Analytical Questions
1.	Which products/content are most frequently interacted with by users?
2.	Which user segments have similar purchase/viewing behaviors?
3.	What products/content have high engagement but low recommendation exposure?
4.	How do seasonal trends affect product/content interactions?
5.	What time of the day does purchase activity increases?
6.	What are the most frequent item id predicted?
7.	What is the percentage of visitors who made purchase?
8.	What are the total transactions over time?

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering (CBF):** Recommends items based on item features (TF-IDF + cosine similarity).  
- **Collaborative Filtering (CF):** Learns from user-item interactions.  
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines CBF + CF for balanced results.  
- **User Segmentation:** K-Means clustering of user behavior.  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Isolation Forest to detect unusual/bot-like users.  
- **Category Graph:** Visualizes category hierarchy using `networkx`.  
- **Streamlit UI:** Interactive dashboard with multiple recommendation modes.
